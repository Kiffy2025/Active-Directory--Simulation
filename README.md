├── OU: HR Team
│   └── Users: Alex.HR
    

├── OU: IT
│   └── Users:Mateen.IT
```

## Group Policy (GPO)

Created and linked using **Group Policy Management Console (gpmc.msc)**:

- **GPO Name**: `DisableRemovableDrives`
- **Linked to**: OU: IT Department
- **Policy Configured**:
  - `Computer Configuration` > `Administrative Templates` > `System` > `Removable Storage Access`
  - Set **"All Removable Storage classes: Deny all access"** to **Enabled**

Result: USB and external drives are disabled for all users in the **Accounts OU**.
